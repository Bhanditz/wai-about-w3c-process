The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops web accessibility
guidelines, technical specifications, and educational resources to help
make the web accessible to people with disabilities. This document
introduces how WAI works through a process designed to:

-   ensure broad community input, and
-   encourage [consensus](http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/policies.html#Consensus) development.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops web standards such as HTML, CSS, etc. WAI is part of W3C and follows the [W3C Process](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/) for developing web standards.

W3C's web standards are called ***W3C Recommendations***. WAI has developed the following W3C Recommendations:

-   Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, see [WCAG Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php)
-   Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines, see [ATAG Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag.php)
-   User Agent Accessibility Guidelines, see [UAAG Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/uaag.php)
-   Accessible Rich Internet Applications, see [WAI-ARIA Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria)

**\[WAI Accessibility Guidelines\] that are \[W3C Recommendations\] are
\[Web Standards\]**

The milestones that a W3C "technical report" goes through on its way to
becoming a W3C Recommendation are listed below.
{:#stages}

1.  {:#wd}![draft documents:]({{site.github.url}}/content-images/wai-about-w3c-process/wd.gif){:style="float:left; margin-right: 1em; clear: left;"} **Working Draft**: Working Drafts
    are published and announced specifically to ask for review and input
    from the community. Often there are issues that a Working Group
    would particularly like input on. Usually multiple Working Drafts of
    a technical report are published.
2.  {:#lcwd}![complete technical report:]({{site.github.url}}/content-images/wai-about-w3c-process/lcwd.gif){:style="float:left; margin-right: 1em; clear: left;"} **Wide Review
    Working Draft**: When a Working Group believes it has addressed all
    comments and technical requirements, it provides the complete
    document for community review and announces that it is ready for
    wide review.
3.  {:#cr}![using computer with technical report:]({{site.github.url}}/content-images/wai-about-w3c-process/cr.gif){:style="float:left; margin-right: 1em; clear: left;"} **Candidate
    Recommendation**: The main purpose of Candidate Recommendation is to
    ensure that the technical report can be implemented. W3C encourages
    developers to use the technical report in their projects. The
    technical report is stable at this stage; however, it may change
    based on implementation experience.
4.  {:#pr}![endorsing technical report:]({{site.github.url}}/content-images/wai-about-w3c-process/pr.gif){:style="float:left; margin-right: 1em; clear: left;"} **Proposed
    Recommendation**: After there are implementations of each feature of
    the technical report, W3C announces it as a Proposed Recommendation.
    At this stage, the report is submitted to the W3C Membership for
    endorsement.
5.  {:#rec}![approved technical report:]({{site.github.url}}/content-images/wai-about-w3c-process/rec.gif){:style="float:left; margin-right: 1em; clear: left;"} **W3C Recommendation
    (Web Standard)**: Once there is significant support for the
    technical report from the W3C Members, the W3C Director, and the
    public, it is published as a Recommendation. W3C encourages
    widespread deployment of its Recommendations.

That was a simplified description of the process. For the definitive
version, see the [W3C Process Document, Section 7: W3C Technical Report
Development Process](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Reports).

WAI also develops documents that support the guidelines and do not go
through the process described above.
{:#other_docs}

-   **W3C Working Group Notes** are advisory technical reports, not
    standards. Most of WAI's Techniques documents are Notes. They help
    developers implement the WAI guidelines. For example, [Techniques
    for WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-TECHS/) gives specific details
    and practical examples of how to meet WCAG.
-   **WAI Resources** and EOWG Resources cover a wide range of web
    accessibility topics, such as [Essential Components of Web
    Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/components.php), [WCAG
    2.0 at a Glance](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/glance/Overview.html),
    [Easy Checks - A First Review of Web
    Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/preliminary), and many
    others listed in the [WAI
    Resources](http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/Overview).

WAI's W3C Recommendations, Working Group Notes, and Resources are
developed in [WAI Working Groups](http://www.w3.org/WAI/groups.html)
with input from the community. WAI actively encourages broad
participation from industry, disability organizations, accessibility
researchers, government, and others interested in web accessibility.

**[Participating in WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/participation)**
describes ways that you can contribute to WAI's accessibility work,
including reviewing and commenting on WAI guidelines as they are being
developed.

**The best time to comment is when WAI announces Working Drafts for
review**. Please send your comments early in the process, when the
Working Group can most effectively address them in the developing
technical report. Technical comments sent after the wide review period
have less weight, and a Working Group might not be able to make
substantive changes late in the process. The W3C Process Document
provides more information on [Reviews and Review
Responsibilities](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#doc-reviews).

To get WAI announcements, you can subscribe to the following:

-   [WAI Interest Group mailing
    list](http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/#mailinglist)
-   [WAI RSS Feed](http://www.w3.org/WAI/highlights/about-rss.html)

The review announcements tell you the review period dates and where to
send comments.
